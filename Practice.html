            Erase me completely
            Start over, set finally free
            Destroy me completely
            Start over eternally

            Taking control of falling apart
            Choosing to crawl when I can no longer walk
            Trapped in these four walls, no fear of the dark, no fear of the dark
            
            Remember when I stole your future?
            I severed the divine, forced forward
            As I felt the wind slow, I let the guilt grow
            We watched the sky fall apart
            Light to dark
            The start of the decline, self tortured
            A short departure, deceivers design
            
            Hide what lies inside
            Sick of the lies you're telling me
            Ever-paralyzed
            Push the reset, we'll begin again
            I've been so disconnected, feeling the distance, never free
            A time despised
            Push the reset, we'll begin again
            
            Erase me completely
            Start over eternally
            
            We are left wondering why we always fall
            The days are turning to years, becoming nothing at all
            Repeat, recede into this constant sleep
            The mind in stasis, a coma deep
            
            Hide what lies inside
            Sick of the lies you're telling me
            Ever-paralyzed
            Push the reset, we'll begin again
            I've been so disconnected, feeling the distance, never free
            A time despised
            Push the reset, we'll begin again
            
            Taking control of falling apart
            Choosing to crawl when I can no longer walk
            Trapped in these four walls, no fear of the dark, no fear of the dark
            
            Erase me, completely, start over
            Push the reset, we'll begin again
            Push the reset, we'll begin again
